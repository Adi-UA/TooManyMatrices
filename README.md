# TooManyMatrices

Have you ever looked at a particularly gnarly math problem and thought, "there is _no way_ I can manually calculate _that_ without messing up"? If you have, then `TooManyMatrices` might ease your woes (your discrete math woes anyway) by running those calculations for you.

`TooManyMatrices` is a project in discrete mathematics where we ([@AdiUA](https://github.com/Adi-UA) and [@dev-ved30](https://github.com/dev-ved30)) build a website to solve all kinds of discrete math problems that are annoying to compute by hand or calculator.

## Current Status

At this stage, we have matrix functionality and some basic calculations like factorial, r-permutations and r-combinations (WIP). We are currently implementing and refining code interactions between the front and back end.
